## Subject Line Mastery

### Subject Line Formulas

| Formula | Example | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Curiosity** | "This changed everything for me..." | Newsletters, content |
| **Benefit** | "Double your leads in 30 days" | Sales, launches |
| **Question** | "Are you making this mistake?" | Engagement, opens |
| **Urgency** | "Last chance: 24 hours left" | Sales, deadlines |
| **Personal** | "[Name], quick question" | 1:1 feel, high-value |
| **Number** | "5 ways to [achieve result]" | Educational, lists |
| **How-to** | "How to [achieve result] without [pain]" | Tutorials |
| **Social Proof** | "How [Person] achieved [Result]" | Testimonials |
| **Contrarian** | "Why [common advice] is wrong" | Thought leadership |
| **FOMO** | "Everyone's talking about this..." | Trends, news |

### Subject Line Best Practices

| Element | Best Practice | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Length** | 30-50 characters (mobile-friendly) | "Your cart is waiting..." |
| **Personalization** | Use name or data | "[Name], you left this behind" |
| **Emojis** | 1 max, relevant | "🔥 Flash sale: 50% off today" |
| **Numbers** | Specific > vague | "7 tips" vs. "tips" |
| **Power words** | Create emotion | Free, new, secret, exclusive |
| **Lowercase** | Can feel personal | "hey, got a minute?" |
| **Questions** | Spark curiosity | "Did you see this?" |

### Subject Line A/B Tests

| Test | Variation A | Variation B |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Length | Short (4 words) | Long (8+ words) |
| Personalization | With [Name] | Without name |
| Emoji | With emoji | Without emoji |
| Case | Title Case | lowercase |
| Tone | Formal | Casual |
| Specificity | Numbers | No numbers |
| Format | Question | Statement |

## Preview Text Strategy

### Preview Text Formula

```
Subject Line + Preview Text = Complete Hook

Subject: "You're leaving money on the table"
Preview: "Here's the simple fix (takes 5 minutes)"

Subject: "Quick question about your goals"
Preview: "I noticed something and wanted to reach out personally"

Subject: "Your cart is waiting"
Preview: "Complete your order and get free shipping"
```

### Preview Text Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Complement the subject | Repeat the subject |
| Add curiosity | Be vague |
| Include benefit | Leave empty (shows "View in browser") |
| Keep under 90 chars | Write an essay |
| Test different approaches | Ignore preview text |

## Email Body Framework

### Email Structure (PAS Formula)

```
PROBLEM
Open with the pain point or challenge the reader faces.
Make them feel understood.

AGITATE
Expand on the consequences of not solving the problem.
Build emotional urgency.

SOLUTION
Present your content/offer as the answer.
Show the transformation possible.

CTA
Clear, single call to action.
Make it obvious what to do next.
```

### Email Structure (AIDA Formula)

```
ATTENTION
Strong opening line that hooks immediately.
Pattern interrupt or bold statement.

INTEREST
Expand on the hook with relevant details.
Show you understand their situation.

DESIRE
Paint the picture of the outcome.
Benefits, proof, transformation.

ACTION
Clear CTA with urgency or reason to act now.
Single focus, make it easy.
```

### Opening Line Examples

| **Bold statement** | "Everything you've been told about [topic] is wrong." |
| **Personal** | "I've been thinking about you and wanted to share something..." |
| **Story** | "Last Tuesday, something unexpected happened..." |

| **Empathy** | "I know how frustrating it is when [pain point]..." |

## CTA Best Practices

### CTA Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Single focus** | One CTA per email (or one primary) |
| **Action verb** | "Get", "Download", "Start", "Join" |
| **Benefit-driven** | "Get your free guide" vs. "Click here" |
| **Visible** | Button + text link (different preferences) |
| **Urgent** | "Get it now" vs. "Get it" |
| **Repeated** | Place CTA 2-3 times in longer emails |

### CTA Button Copy Examples

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Submit | Get My Free Guide |
| Click Here | Start My Free Trial |
| Learn More | Show Me How |
| Buy Now | Get Instant Access |
| Download | Send Me the Checklist |
| Register | Save My Spot |

## Newsletter Framework

### Newsletter Structure

```
HEADER
├── Logo/branding
├── View in browser link
└── Date/issue number (optional)

INTRO (Personal touch)
├── Greeting
├── Quick personal update or observation
└── Transition to content

MAIN CONTENT
├── Section 1: Primary value (article, insight, tutorial)
├── Section 2: Secondary content (tips, resources)
└── Section 3: Curated links or recommendations

CTA
├── Primary action you want readers to take
└── Secondary options (share, reply, etc.)

FOOTER
├── About/why they're receiving this
├── Social links
├── Unsubscribe link
└── Contact info
```

### Newsletter Content Ideas

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Educational** | How-to guides, tutorials, tips |
| **Curated** | Best articles, tools, resources |
| **Behind-scenes** | Process, journey, lessons learned |
| **News/Trends** | Industry updates, analysis |
| **Q&A** | Reader questions answered |
| **Case Studies** | Success stories, examples |
| **Interviews** | Expert conversations |
| **Challenges** | Weekly/monthly activities |

## Email Copywriting Techniques

### Psychological Triggers

| Trigger | How to Use |
|---------|------------|
| **Scarcity** | Limited spots, ending soon, few left |
| **Social proof** | Testimonials, numbers, logos |
| **Authority** | Credentials, featured in, years of experience |
| **Reciprocity** | Give value first, then ask |
| **Commitment** | Small ask → bigger ask |
| **Liking** | Personal stories, relatability, warmth |
| **FOMO** | Others are doing it, don't miss out |

### Formatting for Readability

| Technique | Why It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Short paragraphs | 1-3 sentences max, easy to scan |
| White space | Gives eyes rest, less overwhelming |
| Bold key phrases | Highlights important points |
| Bullet points | Easy to digest lists |
| Conversational tone | Feels personal, not corporate |
| Questions | Creates engagement, breaks pattern |
| PS section | High-read area, second CTA opportunity |

### The PS Strategy

```
Use PS for:
- Repeat CTA differently
- Add urgency/scarcity
- Include bonus or incentive
- Personal note
- Answer common objection

Example:
"P.S. — If you're wondering if this will work for [objection],
here's what [Customer Name] said: [testimonial]"
```

## Email Automation Flows

### Key Automated Flows

| Flow | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Welcome Series | New subscriber | Onboard, introduce brand |
| Abandoned Cart | Cart abandoned | Recover sale |
| Browse Abandonment | Viewed but didn't add | Re-engage interest |
| Post-Purchase | After purchase | Confirm, upsell, retain |
| Win-Back | Inactive 30-90 days | Re-engage dormant |
| Birthday/Anniversary | Date-based | Relationship building |
| Re-engagement | No open in 60 days | Clean list or win back |

### Flow Design Principles

```
ENTRY TRIGGER
└── Clear, specific action or condition

TIMING
└── Based on user behavior, not arbitrary

CONTENT
└── Relevant to the trigger and stage

EXIT CONDITIONS
└── When to stop (purchased, unsubscribed, engaged)

BRANCHING

```
