## Copywriting Frameworks

### AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

Best for: Landing pages, sales emails, ads, long-form sales copy

| Stage | Purpose | Techniques |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Attention | Stop the scroll | Bold claim, question, surprising stat |
| Interest | Engage curiosity | Present the problem, show understanding |
| Desire | Create want | Benefits, transformation, social proof |
| Action | Drive conversion | Clear CTA, urgency, risk reversal |

**Example — Landing Page:**
```
[ATTENTION]
"You're losing $47,000 per year to inefficient processes."

[INTEREST]
Every hour your team spends on manual tasks is an hour not spent on growth.
The average business wastes 23 hours per week on work that could be automated.

[DESIRE]
Imagine your team focused only on high-impact work:
✓ 10x faster reporting
✓ Zero manual data entry
✓ Real-time insights at your fingertips

### PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)

Best for: Email sequences, social posts, VSL scripts, short-form ads

| Stage | Purpose | Techniques |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Problem | Identify pain | Specific, relatable problem |
| Agitate | Intensify urgency | Consequences, emotional impact |
| Solution | Present relief | Your offer as the answer |

**Example — Email:**
```
[PROBLEM]
You spend 3 hours every Sunday planning next week's content.

[AGITATE]
That's 156 hours per year — almost a full month of work.
And after all that planning, you still scramble to post on time.
The stress never ends. The results never improve.

[SOLUTION]
Our Content Calendar System plans your entire month in 30 minutes.
Templates, prompts, and a proven posting schedule — all done for you.

### BAB (Before → After → Bridge)

Best for: Case studies, testimonials, storytelling posts, transformation narratives

| Stage | Purpose | Techniques |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Before | Show current pain | Relatable struggle |
| After | Paint the outcome | Specific, desirable result |
| Bridge | Connect the two | Your product/method as path |

**Example — Case Study Post:**
```
[BEFORE]
6 months ago, João was posting 2x per month and stuck at 800 followers.
He spent hours on each post and still got crickets.

[AFTER]
Today, João has 47,000 followers and a waitlist of 200+ clients.
He posts daily in under 30 minutes.

## Headline Formulas

### Proven Headline Structures

| Formula | Template | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| How to + Benefit | "How to [achieve X] without [obstacle]" | "How to double your followers without posting daily" |
| Number + Result | "[Number] ways to [achieve result]" | "7 proven ways to write headlines that convert" |
| Question | "Are you making this [X] mistake?" | "Are you making this Instagram mistake that kills reach?" |
| Contrarian | "Why [common belief] is wrong" | "Why posting more content is hurting your growth" |
| Specific result | "[Specific outcome] in [timeframe]" | "10K followers in 90 days: the exact playbook" |
| Social proof | "How [person] achieved [result]" | "How this creator went from 0 to 100K in 6 months" |

### Headline Power Words

**Urgency:** Now, Today, Instant, Quick, Fast, Limited, Last chance
**Curiosity:** Secret, Hidden, Little-known, Surprising, Strange
**Value:** Free, Save, Proven, Guaranteed, Results, Transform
**Exclusivity:** Only, Exclusive, Members-only, Insider, VIP
**Emotion:** Amazing, Incredible, Powerful, Revolutionary, Life-changing

## CTA Best Practices

### CTA Principles

1. **Use action verbs** — Start with "Get", "Start", "Download", "Join", "Discover"
2. **Be specific** — "Start your free trial" beats "Submit"
3. **Create urgency** — When genuine: "Only 10 spots left"
4. **Reduce risk** — "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime"
5. **One CTA per context** — Don't overwhelm with choices

### CTA Examples by Context

| Context | Weak CTA | Strong CTA |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Landing page | "Submit" | "Start my free trial" |
| Email | "Click here" | "Get the template now" |
| Social post | "Link in bio" | "Save this + follow for more" |
| Ad | "Learn more" | "See how it works in 60 seconds" |
| Blog post | "Subscribe" | "Get weekly tips (join 10K readers)" |

### CTA Formulas

```
[Action verb] + [Specific benefit] + [Urgency/Risk reversal]

Examples:
- "Download the free guide (2-minute read)"
- "Start saving 10 hours/week — free for 14 days"
- "Join 5,000+ marketers getting weekly insights"
- "Get instant access — no email required"
```

## A/B Testing Copy

### What to Test

| Element | Variations to Try |
|---------|-------------------|
| Headlines | Different frameworks, lengths, angles |
| CTAs | Action verbs, benefit focus, urgency |
| Opening lines | Question vs. statement vs. stat |
| Social proof | Numbers, names, specificity |
| Length | Short vs. detailed |

### A/B Variation Framework

For every piece of copy, generate variations that differ in:

1. **Angle** — Different pain point or benefit emphasized
2. **Tone** — Professional vs. casual, urgent vs. relaxed
3. **Length** — Concise vs. detailed
4. **Format** — Paragraph vs. bullets vs. steps

**Example — Headline A/B Variations:**
```
Original: "Grow your Instagram following faster"

Variation A (Specific number): "Grow to 10K followers in 90 days"
Variation B (Pain point): "Stop posting into the void — get followers who engage"
Variation C (Curiosity): "The Instagram strategy they don't want you to know"
Variation D (Social proof): "How 500+ creators grew their audience 3x"
```

## Tone Adaptation

### Tone Spectrum

| Tone | Characteristics | Best For |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Professional | Formal, credible, precise | B2B, LinkedIn, whitepapers |
| Conversational | Friendly, relatable, casual | Instagram, blogs, newsletters |
| Urgent | Direct, scarce, FOMO-driven | Sales, launches, limited offers |
| Inspirational | Motivating, emotional, story-driven | Personal development, branding |
| Educational | Clear, helpful, step-by-step | Tutorials, how-to, SEO content |
| Bold | Confident, contrarian, provocative | Thought leadership, viral content |

### Adapting Tone

Same message, different tones:

**Professional:**
"Our platform reduces content creation time by 73%, enabling teams to focus on strategic initiatives."

**Conversational:**
"Imagine cutting your content time by 73%. That's 3 hours back every day to do work that actually matters."

**Urgent:**
"You're wasting 73% of your content time. Every day you wait is another day of lost productivity."

**Inspirational:**
"What would you do with 73% more time? Our users are building empires with the hours they've reclaimed."
