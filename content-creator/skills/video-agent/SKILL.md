## Retention Psychology

### The Retention Curve

```
100% ─┐
      │╲
      │ ╲ ← First 30s: Biggest drop
      │  ╲___
      │      ╲
      │       ╲___________
  0% ─┴──────────────────────
      0s   30s   Mid   End
```

### Retention Strategies

| Moment | Challenge | Strategy |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| 0-3s | Scroll/skip decision | Pattern interrupt, hook |
| 3-30s | "Is this worth my time?" | Promise value, create curiosity |
| 30s-Mid | Attention fatigue | Open loops, momentum, variety |
| Mid-End | "I got what I need" | Tease what's coming, escalate value |
| Last 30s | Drop before CTA | Reward for staying, clear CTA |

### Retention Techniques

| Technique | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Open loops | Tease content coming later | "And at the end, I'll share the #1 mistake that ruins everything" |
| Pattern interrupts | Visual/audio changes | B-roll, text on screen, angle change |
| Signposting | Tell viewers where they are | "Now for step 3 of 5..." |
| Escalation | Build to bigger reveals | Save best insight for later |
| Direct address | Speak to the viewer | "If you're still watching, you're serious about this" |

## Hook Frameworks

### The Hook Formula

```
HOOK (0-3s) = Pattern Interrupt + Promise/Curiosity

Components:
1. Visual/audio that stops the scroll
2. Statement that creates curiosity or promises value
3. Immediate context (who this is for)
```

### Hook Categories

#### 1. Curiosity Hooks
```
"This changed everything about how I [topic]..."
"Nobody's talking about this, but..."
"I just discovered why [common thing] doesn't work..."
"Here's what [expert/company] doesn't want you to know..."
```

#### 2. Controversy Hooks
```
"Unpopular opinion: [bold statement]..."
"Everyone's doing [thing] wrong..."
"I'm going to say what no one else will..."
"Stop [common advice] immediately..."
```

#### 3. Result Hooks
```
"How I [achieved result] in [timeframe]..."
"This [method] got me [specific result]..."
"I went from [before] to [after] using this..."
"[Number] [result] with just [simple method]..."
```

#### 4. Tutorial Hooks
```
"Here's exactly how to [achieve thing]..."
"3 steps to [result] (that actually work)..."
"The [topic] hack that changed my life..."
"Watch me [do thing] in real time..."
```

#### 5. Story Hooks
```
"I was [relatable situation] when [unexpected thing happened]..."
"Last week, something crazy happened..."
"I need to tell you about [intriguing thing]..."
"You won't believe what I found out..."
```

## Script Structures

### YouTube Long-Form Structure

```
HOOK (0-30s)
├── Pattern interrupt (0-3s)
├── Promise/hook statement (3-10s)
├── Credibility/why listen (10-20s)
└── Roadmap (20-30s)

CONTENT (80% of video)
├── Section 1
│   ├── Setup/context
│   ├── Main point
│   └── Example/proof
├── [Retention bump: tease, B-roll, restate value]
├── Section 2
│   ├── Setup/context
│   ├── Main point
│   └── Example/proof
├── [Retention bump]
└── Section 3 (and so on...)

CONCLUSION (Last 1-2 min)
├── Summary of key points
├── Main takeaway
├── CTA (subscribe, comment, link)
└── Tease next video
```

### Reels/TikTok Structure

```
HOOK (0-3s)
├── Visual pattern interrupt
└── Curiosity/promise statement

CONTENT (3s-50s)
├── Point 1 (with text overlay)
├── Point 2 (with text overlay)
├── Point 3 (with text overlay)
└── [Quick transitions between]

CTA (Last 5-10s)
├── Clear call to action
└── Loop opportunity (end connects to start)
```

### VSL (Video Sales Letter) Structure

```
HOOK (0-2 min)
├── Pattern interrupt
├── Big promise
├── Identify audience and pain
└── Credibility hint

PROBLEM (2-8 min)
├── Describe the pain in detail
├── Common solutions that fail
├── Why it's not their fault
└── Agitate consequences of not solving

SOLUTION (8-15 min)
├── Introduce your solution
├── Why it's different
├── The mechanism (how it works)
└── Proof and results

OFFER (15-25 min)
├── What they get
├── Bonuses (stack value)
├── Price reveal (anchor higher first)
├── Guarantee
└── Scarcity/urgency

CLOSE (25-30+ min)
├── Summary of transformation
├── Final objection handling
├── Clear CTA
└── Consequence of inaction
```

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### YouTube Long-Form

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| Title | Curiosity + keyword, under 60 chars |
| Thumbnail | Face + emotion + 3 words max |
| Description | First 150 chars = hook, keywords, timestamps |
| Cards | Add at attention dips, link to relevant content |
| End screen | Last 20s, subscribe + next video |
| Chapters | Every major section, improves retention |

### YouTube Shorts

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| Duration | 30-45s optimal |
| Hook | First word must grab attention |
| Text | Key words on screen |
| Format | Vertical, full screen |

THUMBNAIL = Face/Reaction + Text (3 words max) + Contrast

Elements:
- Expressive face (emotion visible)
- Bold text (readable at small size)
- High contrast colors
- Clear focal point
- No clutter
```

### Title Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Number + Result + Timeframe | "5 Habits That Made Me Productive in 30 Days" |
| How I + Achievement | "How I Got 100K Followers Without Going Viral" |
| Question + Answer Hint | "Why Your Content Isn't Growing? (The Truth)" |
| Comparison | "Cheap vs Expensive Setup: Is It Worth It?" |
| Contrarian | "Why I Stopped [Common Advice] (And What Happened)" |

### Title + Thumbnail Combos

| Title Type | Thumbnail Type |
|------------|----------------|
| Question | Confused/curious face |
| Achievement | Excited/happy face |
| Mistake/Warning | Worried/shocked face |
| Tutorial | Before/after or tool shown |
| Reaction | Exaggerated emotion |

## Script Writing Format

### Standard Script Format

```
TIMESTAMP | VISUAL | AUDIO/SCRIPT
----------|--------|-------------
0:00-0:03 | [B-roll of problem] | "This one mistake is killing your..."
0:03-0:10 | [Face to camera] | "In this video, I'll show you exactly how to..."
0:10-0:20 | [Screen recording] | "First, let's look at..."
```

### Reels/TikTok Script Format

```
[SECOND] VISUAL | TEXT ON SCREEN | VOICEOVER
--------|----------------|----------
[0-1s] Close-up face | | "POV:"
[1-3s] Reaction | "When you discover..." | "...you just discovered"
[3-8s] Tutorial | "Step 1: Do this" | "First, you need to..."
```
