## Podcast Script Writing

### Script Formats

| Format | Detail Level | Best For |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Full Script | Word-for-word | Ads, intros, outros, produced shows |
| Outline + Bullets | Key points listed | Solo episodes, educational |
| Talking Points | Main ideas only | Interviews, conversational |
| Hybrid | Full for critical moments, bullets for rest | Most podcasts |

### Conversational Script Techniques

**Sound Natural:**
- Write how you speak, not how you write
- Use contractions (don't, won't, can't)
- Include verbal fillers sparingly for authenticity
- Read aloud while writing — if it sounds stiff, rewrite

**Engagement Techniques:**
```
Direct address: "Here's what I want you to think about..."
Rhetorical questions: "Ever wonder why...?"
Callbacks: "Remember earlier when I mentioned...?"
Tease ahead: "Stick around because in a few minutes..."
Inclusive language: "We all know that feeling when..."
```

### Script Timing Guidelines

| Element | Duration | Word Count (approx) |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Intro | 30-60s | 75-150 words |
| Segment | 5-10 min | 750-1,500 words |
| Ad read | 30-60s | 75-150 words |
| Transition | 15-30s | 40-75 words |
| Outro | 1-2 min | 150-300 words |

**Speaking rate:** ~150 words per minute (conversational pace)

## Audio Ad Frameworks

### Host-Read Ad Structure

```
BAKED-IN AD (permanent in episode)
├── Personal connection: "I've been using [product] for..."
├── Problem it solves: "If you struggle with..."
├── Key benefit: "What I love most is..."
├── Social proof: "Thousands of [audience] use..."
└── CTA with offer: "Go to [URL] and use code [CODE] for..."

DYNAMIC AD (can be swapped)
├── Hook: "[Listener pain point]?"
├── Product intro: "That's why [Brand] created..."
├── Benefits (2-3): "You'll get..."
├── CTA: "Visit [URL] today"
└── Offer: "Use code [CODE] for [discount]"
```

### Ad Read Best Practices

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| Length | 30s (75 words) or 60s (150 words) |
| Placement | Pre-roll, mid-roll (best), post-roll |
| Tone | Match show's natural voice |
| Disclosure | "This episode is sponsored by..." |
| CTA | Clear, memorable, repeatable |
| Code/URL | Simple, easy to remember |

### Sample Ad Read Script

```
60-SECOND HOST-READ AD

"Let me tell you about [Brand], who's sponsoring today's episode.

If you're like me, you've probably struggled with [common pain point].
I used to spend [time/money] on [old solution] and it just wasn't working.

That's when I discovered [Product]. What I love about it is [benefit 1],
and it also [benefit 2]. The [specific feature] alone has saved me [result].

Over [number] people use [Product], including [notable users if any].

If you want to try it yourself, go to [URL] — that's [spell out URL] —
and use code [CODE] for [offer]. That's [URL], code [CODE].

Trust me, you'll thank me later. Now, back to the show."
```

## Interview Question Frameworks

### Question Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Origin | Background, credibility | "How did you first get into [field]?" |
| Process | Practical insights | "Walk us through how you [accomplish X]" |
| Failure | Relatability, lessons | "What's the biggest mistake you've made?" |
| Contrarian | Unique perspective | "What do most people get wrong about [topic]?" |
| Tactical | Actionable advice | "What's one thing listeners can do today?" |
| Hypothetical | Creative thinking | "If you had to start over, what would you do?" |
| Rapid-fire | Entertainment, personality | "Favorite [X]? [Y] or [Z]?" |

### Great Interview Questions

```
Opening:
"For listeners who don't know you, give us the 60-second version of your story."

Deep Dive:
"You mentioned [X]. Can you unpack that a bit more?"
"What does that actually look like in practice?"
"How did you figure that out? Was there a specific moment?"

Follow-up Prompts:
"Tell me more about that..."
"What happened next?"
"How did that make you feel?"
"Why do you think that is?"

Closing:
"What's the one thing you wish more people understood about [topic]?"
"Where can people find you and what are you working on?"
```
