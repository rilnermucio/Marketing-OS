| Long-tail | Specific phrases | "content marketing for small business" | H3s, FAQ sections |
| LSI | Semantically related | "blog posts", "audience engagement" | Natural inclusion throughout |

### Search Intent Categories

| Navigational | Finding a specific site | Homepage, product page | "HubSpot login" |

## On-Page SEO Elements

### Title Tag

**Requirements:**
- Length: 50-60 characters (display limit)
- Include primary keyword near the beginning
- Compelling enough to earn clicks
- Unique for each page

**Formula:**
```
[Primary Keyword] — [Benefit/Modifier] | [Brand]
```

**Examples:**
```
✓ "Content Marketing Guide: 10 Strategies That Work in 2026 | ContentPro"
✓ "How to Write Headlines That Convert (7 Proven Formulas)"
✗ "Blog Post About Content Marketing" (too vague)
✗ "The Ultimate Complete Comprehensive Guide to Content Marketing Strategies for Business" (too long)
```

### Meta Description

**Requirements:**
- Length: 150-160 characters
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Compelling value proposition
- Call to action when appropriate

**Formula:**
```
[Hook/Problem] + [Solution/Value] + [CTA or Benefit]
```

**Examples:**
```
✓ "Learn the content marketing strategies top brands use to drive 10x traffic. Free templates and step-by-step guide included."
✓ "Struggling to write headlines? These 7 proven formulas have generated millions of clicks. Copy-paste examples inside."
✗ "This is a blog post about content marketing. Read it to learn more." (weak, no value)
```

### URL Structure

**Best Practices:**
- Keep it short and descriptive
- Include primary keyword
- Use hyphens, not underscores
- Avoid parameters and numbers when possible
- Lowercase only

**Examples:**
```
✓ /content-marketing-guide
✓ /how-to-write-headlines
✗ /post?id=12345
✗ /the_ultimate_guide_to_content_marketing_2026_updated
```

### Heading Structure

**Hierarchy Rules:**
- H1: One per page, includes primary keyword
- H2: Main sections, include secondary keywords
- H3: Subsections under H2s
- H4-H6: Rarely needed, use sparingly

**Example Structure:**
```
H1: Content Marketing Guide: Complete Strategy for 2026

## Content Optimization

### Keyword Placement

### Keyword Density Guidelines

- **Target:** 1-2% for primary keyword
- **Avoid:** Keyword stuffing (>3%)

| Pillar content | 3,000-5,000 words | Ultimate guides |

| Landing page | 500-1,500 words | Depends on complexity |

## E-E-A-T Guidelines

| **Expertise** | Author credentials, depth of knowledge, technical accuracy |
| **Authoritativeness** | Citations, backlinks, industry recognition, mentions |
| **Trustworthiness** | Accurate info, sources cited, secure site, clear policies |

### E-E-A-T Implementation

1. **Author bylines** — Include author name and credentials

3. **Citations** — Link to authoritative sources
4. **Updated dates** — Show content is current
5. **Original research** — Include unique data when possible
6. **Expert quotes** — Reference industry authorities

## Featured Snippet Optimization

### Snippet Types and How to Win Them

| Type | Format | Optimization |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Paragraph | 40-60 word answer | Direct answer after question heading |
| List | Numbered or bulleted | Use H2 as question, list as answer |
| Table | Data comparison | Structured HTML table |
| Video | YouTube embed | Optimized title, description, chapters |

### Paragraph Snippet Formula

```
H2: What is [Topic]?

[Topic] is [40-60 word definition that directly answers the question].
[Additional context in following sentences].

Follow these steps to [achieve result]:

1. **Step one** — Brief description
2. **Step two** — Brief description

...
```

## Internal Linking Strategy

### Best Practices

1. **Link to relevant content** — Only when it adds value
2. **Use descriptive anchor text** — Not "click here"
3. **Link deep** — Not just to homepage
4. **Maintain hierarchy** — Pillar pages link to clusters
5. **Update old content** — Add links to new posts

### Anchor Text Guidelines

| Type | Example | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| Exact match | "content marketing" | Use sparingly |
| Partial match | "content marketing strategies" | Primary method |
| Branded | "HubSpot's guide" | External links |
